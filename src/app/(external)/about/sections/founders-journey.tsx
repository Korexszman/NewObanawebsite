								In 2012, our founder began his journey as a pioneer staff at{" "}
								<span className="font-bold">Jumia</span>, serving as a Category
								Manager for Fashion. Jumia, one of Africa&apos;s leading
								e-commerce platforms, revolutionized online shopping by
								providing a marketplace for various consumer goods, including
								fashion, electronics, and household items. This experience
								provided deep insights into the challenges and opportunities
								within the online retail industry.

								In 2013, he moved to{" "}
								<span className="font-bold">Konga.com</span>, another major
								e-commerce platform in Nigeria, where he took charge of
								developing the fashion category. During his time at Konga, he
								played a key role in spearheading the creation of private-label
								brands, which generated an impressive{" "}
								<span className="font-bold">₦800 million in revenue</span>.
								Additionally, he was instrumental in migrating Konga from a
								1st-party retail model to a 3rd-party retail marketplace, where
								he identified a major gap in the market—local vendors needed to
								source products internationally to sell on online platforms
								locally.

							<p data-aos="fade-right">
								By 2015, he co-founded{" "}
								<span className="font-bold">Fazsion.ng</span>, initially

								alongside Bo Hansen from Denmark. However, based on the market
								gap observed during his time at Konga, the business pivoted to a
								B2B wholesale model to better serve local vendors.
